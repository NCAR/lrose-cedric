# LROSE CEDRIC
This repository includes the CEDRIC, SPRINT, PPI, CEDIO, and GRID2PS tools for radar data analysis

## Sprint

Sprint is an NCAR/MMM program to interpolate radar measurements taken at spherical coordinates (range, azimuth, and elevation) to regularly-spaced Cartesian or longitude-latitude grids, in either constant height or constant elevation angle surfaces. It accepts radar data in any of the EOL field, univeral, DORADE, or NEXRAD Level II formats. SPRINT outputs interpolated data in pure binary format readable by CEDRIC. A description of the CEDRIC binary format can be found in Appendix D of the documentation for SPRINT or CEDRIC. Data from PPI scans can be interpolated to Cartesian or longitude-latitude grids, either at constant height or constant elevation angle surfaces. Both airborne helical scans and constant-azimuth (RHI) scans from ground-based radars are only interpolated to Cartesian grids (X, Y, and Z).
